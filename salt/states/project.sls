# Project States
#
# To include extra states for the project, you are recommended to
# add standard roles. Such as:

# - celery
# - memcached
# - imaging

# Default stuff for a Django project will be available anyway.
# Add anything extra here that isn't in a role. Though for production
# it will probably need to be anyway. So test here. And make a role if
# you need to for prod.
